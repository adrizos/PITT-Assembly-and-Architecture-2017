#### PITT-Assembly-and-Architecture-2017

This was an incredibly interesting course. Half of the course time was spent on assembly language and the other half on computer organization and building a fully functional single cycle CPU that ran MIPS in the Logism simulation app. 

While I don't know that either of the two main categories covered in this course will comprise a majority of my day-to-day work after gradution, I am confident that the concepts and knowledge learned here have already been applied to many other projects since then, and will continue to provide a great insight into future problems and projects I tackle. 

There was a bit of a rocky start in my understanding of a lower level view of computing, but once I got the hang of things, I found a simple beauty and straight-forwardness in writing programs in assembly. Ultimately, writing a recursive backtracking algorithm in assembly was something I was very proud of, when it worked for the first time.

Additionaly, building a working CPU (albeit a simple one) from the ground up, gave me a great insight into how processors and computers work at the most basic level and how those components are built up to form all the incredible systems we mostly take for granted.
